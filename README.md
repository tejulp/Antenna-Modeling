# Antenna-Modeling
Implemented modeling of Microstrip Antenna by analyzing various design parameters. The raw data was simulated in HFSS software by varying the various design parameters of an antenna which took approximately 72 hours of computation on 3.2GHz clock speed 
The data was optimized using KNN regression in R to model the antenna which saved a huge amount of computing time.
